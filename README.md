# JavaScript Mini Project #01: Pyramid Pattern Generator

This project demonstrates various JavaScript concepts and methods by generating a text-based pyramid pattern. 

## Topics Covered

While working on this project, I learned and applied the following JavaScript concepts:

- `let` and `const` for variable declarations
- Boolean values
- Strings and string methods
- Arrays and array methods
- `for` loop, `for...of` loop, and `while` loop
- Conditional statements (`if/else`)
- Functions, including parameterized functions and calling functions
- Method usage: `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, `.length()`, `.repeat()`, `.log()`
- Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators
- Assignment operators (`=`), equality operator (`==`), and strict equality operator (`===`)
- Concept of hard-coding

## Project Overview

This project generates a pyramid-like pattern of a given character. The height of the pyramid is specified by the `count` variable. The pattern can be inverted or non-inverted based on the `inverted` variable.


### How To Run

```bash
node pyramid.js
